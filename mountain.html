    <p class="narrative"> 
        You and $4 race to the foot of the mountain, it looks to be about 400 ft tall.
    </p>
    
    <p class="narrative"> 
        As you climb, $4 speaks to you in a hushed tone, saying that it helps maintain the tranquil atmosphere.
    </p>
    
    <p class="narrative"> 
        Before you realize it, you're almost at the top. You didn't even feel time passing.
    </p>
    
    <p class="narrative"> 
        $4 looks up at the last rock, then turns back towards you, smiling, and says
    </p>
    
    <p class="narrative"> 
        "$n, talking to you has been so easy and relaxing. I barely felt like I was exerting myself climbing."
    </p>
    
    <p class="narrative"> 
        "I know this might be out of the blue, $n, but I really like you. Like, a lot."
    </p>
    
    <p class="narrative"> 
        "But I still want to stay friends if you don't share the same feelings."
    </p>
    
    <p class="narrative"> 
        "Tell you what. I'm going to climb to the top and sit there facing away."
    </p>
    
    <p class="narrative">
         "If you follow me up, I'll kiss you. Otherwise, I'll meet you back at camp." 
    </p>
    
    <p class="narrative">
        "What happens on the way to Vegas stays in Vegas, right?"
    </p>
    
    <p class="narrative">
        $4 climbs over the rock and slowly moves out of sight.
