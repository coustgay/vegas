    <h1 class="time"> FRIDAY NIGHT </h1>
    
    <p class="narrative"> 
        You walk off into the dark with $2, with only a blacklight to guide your path.
    </p>
    
    <p class="narrative"> 
        As you walk, you begin to talk about really deep stuff like emotions and that kind of thing.
    </p>
    
    <p class="narrative"> 
        You feel yourself getting closer to $2 with each conversation.
    </p>
    
    <p class="narrative"> 
        After a while, you stop looking for scoripions. It's nice just to walk and talk in the darkness.
    </p>
    
    <p class="narrative"> 
        $2 stops walking, and turns off the flashlight. You watch $2 turn toward you in the faint moonlight.
    </p>
    
    <p class="narrative"> 
        $2, after hesitating, says "$n, this has been really nice. Thanks for coming out here with me."
    </p>
    
    <p class="narrative"> 
        $2 looks down at the sand. "There's something I've been meaning to ask you about for a while."
    </p>
    
    <p class="narrative"> 
        After a few more seconds, $2 looks at your face again, then lightly cradles your face in one hand
    </p>
    
    <p class="narrative"> 
        "Would you... go out with me?"
    </p>
